    Hey everyone! Welcome to my fitness page. I wanted to share a bit about my
    fitness journey, which has been anything but linear. A little over a year
    ago, I was *that* skinny guy. I'm talking around 40kg (roughly 88 lbs)
    soaking wet. I was always self-conscious about my physique, and honestly, I
    felt pretty weak. I knew I needed to make a change, but life had other
    plans... Just as I was getting into a good rhythm with my training, I had to
    undergo gallbladder removal surgery. That completely derailed my progress.
    For one month, I was sidelined, unable to train properly, and struggling to
    eat enough to even maintain my weight. It was incredibly frustrating,
    especially when I was so motivated to gain muscle.
  </p>

    Coming back from that surgery was tough. My appetite was all over the place,
    and I needed to find a way to get the calories I needed to fuel my workouts.
    That's when I started incorporating a mass gainer supplement into my diet.
    It's been a game-changer in helping me consistently hit my calorie goals,
    even with a sensitive stomach. Despite the surgery setback, I kept pushing
    forward. I started hitting the gym again, but this time, incorporating more
    efficient training techniques, and focusing on eating more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, the only challenge I'm managing is my day day-to-day job... I'm a
    developer, which means long hours in front of a computer. Finding time for
    the gym and meal prep can be a real challenge. Balancing my schedule with my
    fitness goals is an ongoing learning process. Fast forward to today, and I'm
    almost 60kg (about 132 lbs). That's a 20kg (44lb) gain, even with the
    surgery setback! More importantly than the number on the scale, I feel
    stronger, more confident, and healthier than ever before.

    This blog is where I'll be sharing my experiences, the lessons I've learned
    (and am still learning!), and hopefully, inspiring others who might be in a
    similar place â€“ whether you're a fellow skinny guy looking to bulk up,
    recovering from surgery, juggling a demanding job, or just starting your
    fitness journey.
